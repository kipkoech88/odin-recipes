        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Whisk soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, 
                cilantro, sesame oil, ginger, Sriracha, garlic, lime juice,
                 and lemongrass paste together in a bowl.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Step two</h3>
                <p>
                    Put chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag, 
                    pour marinade over chicken, 
                    and marinate for 2 hours or overnight for an even better flavor.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Three</h3>
                <p>
                    Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grate.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Four</h3>
                <p>
                    Remove chicken thighs from marinade, discarding marinade.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Five</h3>
                <p>
                    Grill chicken thighs until they are no longer 
                    pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                    the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Six</h3>

                    Remove from grill and allow 
                    to rest for a few minutes before serving.
                </p>
