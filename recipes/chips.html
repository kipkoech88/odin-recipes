        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Homemade potato chips are fun and easy.
             Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor 
             with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes.
              Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or
               thinner. 
            I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower,
             corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Transfer potato slices to a large 
                bowl of cold water as you slice them.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Step two</h3>
                <p>
                    Drain slices and rinse under cold water. 
                    Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, 
                    and put slices back in the bowl. 
                    Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Three</h3>
                <p>
                    Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry
                </p>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Step Four</h3>
                <p>
                    Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
